          Dear <span class="first-name">customer</span>,
          <br><br>
          <div>
            A growing puppy is such an amazing thing! Full of engery, fun, and a little mischief, keeping up with the pup can be a handful. We're here to help though!
          <br><br>
          According to our records, it is time to update <span class="puppy-name">Spot</span>'s product size. For your next shipment, we will send you:
          <br><br>
          <div class="new-product-size" style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;">Zgrd 21-32 lbs</div>
          <br><br>
          That's it! You don't have to change or do anything. This is just a note to inform you of the change. Best of all, your price won't increase.
          <br><br>
          <div style="font-weight:600">Wait! My dog isn't that size yet!</div>
          <br>
          Puppies are like kids- everyone grows a slightly different pace. If your dog isn't ready to move up to the next size, just reply to this email and let us know. We'll delay the product update until next month.
        </div>

          Sincerely,
          <br>
