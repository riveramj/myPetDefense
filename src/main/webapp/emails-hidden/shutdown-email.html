          This is an email we never wanted to send out, but unfortunately, My Pet Defense is shutting down today.
          <br><br>
          We're eternally grateful for the trust you've placed in us over the past 5+ years.
          <br><br>
          We'll miss seeing our furry friends' names every month, from Russ to Nova to Gizmo and the rest of the My Pet Defense family.
          <br><br>
          You will be receiving a cancellation confirmation today, but rest assured, all shipments that have be paid for will be sent out shortly.
          <br><br>
          Thanks again, and we wish you and your four-legged friends happy, healthy, and pest-free days.
          <br><br><br>
