Had incorrect sizes for Adventure Plus. Needed to change small size to ZoGuard Plus.

Steps:

Open rules to allow for psql access remotely via network & security -> security groups.

Connect to sql w/command similar to 

psql \
> --host=dev-mypetdefense.cega431oqn39.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com \
> --port=5432 \
> --username mypetdefense \
> --password \
> --dbname=mypetdefense

select * from product where size_c = 0;

update product set name='ZoGuard Plus for Cats' where size_c=0;

select * from product where size_c = 0;

size_c=0 should be the smallest cat size of 1.5

verification is going through flow and ensuring if you click on 1.5 that it selects zoguard plus
